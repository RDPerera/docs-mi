# Troubleshoot MI for VS Code

The following are some ways to troubleshoot errors you may encounter when working with the Micro Integrator for Visual Studio Code extension (MI for VS Code).

## Resolve graphical view errors

To address issues such as frozen views or errors while designing integrations using the graphical view, follow these steps:

1. Open the VS Code Command Palette by selecting **View** > **Command Palette** from the menu, or by using the shortcut `Command`+`Shift`+`P` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows.

2. Select **Developer: Reload Window** from the list of commands.

Refreshing the MI for VS Code extension resolves common errors in the graphical view and restores normal functionality.
