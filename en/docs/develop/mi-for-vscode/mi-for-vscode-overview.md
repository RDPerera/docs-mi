# Micro Integrator for VS Code Overview

WSO2 Micro Integrator (MI) offers an extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that simplifies the development of integration solutions.

This page provides a quick overview of the interface of the MI for VS Code extension.

!!! info
    See [Install Micro Integrator for VS Code]({{base_path}}/develop/mi-for-vscode/install-wso2-mi-for-vscode/) for a complete installation guide of the MI for VS Code extension.

When the extension is installed properly, you can see the WSO2 Micro Integrator icon in the Activity Bar of the VS Code editor.

Click the MI icon to open the extension and get started.

When you open the extension for the first time, you'll see the **Design View** on the right side and the **Micro Integrator: Project Explorer** on the left.

To get started, you need to first create an integration project. You can either open a folder containing an integration project by selecting [**Open MI Project**]({{base_path}}/develop/opening-projects) or create a new integration project from scratch by selecting [**Create New Project**]({{base_path}}/develop/create-integration-project). Alternatively, you can use a [sample](#samples) integration project provided under **Explore Samples**, which contains the required projects and files for a specific use case.

To create a new project you can use the links on the **MI Project Explorer** or **Design View**.

## MI Project Explorer

The **Micro Integrator Project Explorer** provides a view of all the project directories created for your integration solution. Shown below is the **MI Project Explorer** of a sample project.
